## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a potential security vulnerability, please do not open a public issue.

Instead, use GitHub’s private vulnerability reporting feature for this repository.
This allows us to assess the issue and respond in a coordinated and responsible manner.

We aim to review reported vulnerabilities within a reasonable timeframe.
